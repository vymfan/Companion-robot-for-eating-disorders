# Companion-robot-for-eating-disorders

## Description

This project aims to develop an intelligent companion robot for people suffering from behavioural eating disorders. The robot uses camera technology equipped with artificial intelligence to detect the person's behaviour and act accordingly. Artificial intelligence models based on Python codes are used to ensure accurate detection of eating behaviours.

## Features

- Eating behaviour detection:** Use of OAK-D camera and artificial intelligence models to detect a person's eating behaviour.
  
- Adaptive robot response:** The robot is able to adapt its actions according to the behaviours detected, offering personalised support.

- User-friendly interface:** A simple, user-friendly interface enables the user to interact with the robot and monitor progress.

## Technologies used

- Programming language:** Python
- Main libraries:** TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy
- Development tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, Python IDE
